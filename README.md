# ---------------------------------
 ```

**KDOS** is a handmade, artisan-crafted Linux distribution built from the absolute ground up, following the sacred texts of **Linux From Scratch (LFS)**.

Powered by **Musl Libc** and **Toybox**, KDOS aims to be the digital equivalent of a katana: minimal, sharp, and lightweight.

## The Philosophy

Most distros give you a house. KDOS gives you a pile of bricks, a trowel, and a blueprint written in Bash.

1.  **LFS Roots**: We believe in understanding every single byte that goes into the OS. If we didn't compile it, we don't trust it.
2.  **Musl Libc**: Glibc is a metropolitan city. Musl is a Zen garden. We choose the garden.
3.  **Toybox**: Why have 100 core utilities when you can have *one* binary that rules them all?
4.  **No SystemD**: We init like our ancestors did. Simple serial execution.
5.  **KPKG**: We build our own package manager for fun.
